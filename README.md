# Biotools

BioTools takes an input DNA, RNA, or amino acid sequence and performs the following: Sequence manipulation, FASTA parsing, DNA homology, and determining possible coding sequences and their likelihood by examining consensus nucleotides.

There are eight files:
BioTools.py - main
BioAnalyzer.py
BioSequence.py
BioTranslator.py
CODONS.py
FastaParser.py
sequence.fasta
README.md

To test the code, run the BioTools file, which has test code at the bottom.
