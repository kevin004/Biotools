# Biotools
Sequence manipulation, FASTA parsing, DNA homology, and determine possible coding sequences and their likelihood by examining consensus nucleotides.

There are eight files:
Biotools.py - main
BioAnalyzer.py
BioSequence.py
BioTranslator.py
CODONS.py
Fastaparser.py
sequence.fasta
README.md

To test the code, I run the biotools file, which has test code at the bottom. The Fastaparser is simple and designed only for testing purposes; it will be refined at a later time.
