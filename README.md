# Biotools
IP: Need to create tests for each individual file. Tests are created for the BioTools.py file already.
    Will also update the FastaParser for more information instead of simply for use in testing purposes.

BioTools performs the following: Sequence manipulation, FASTA parsing, DNA homology, and determining possible coding sequences and their likelihood by examining consensus nucleotides.

There are eight files:
BioTools.py - main
BioAnalyzer.py
BioSequence.py
BioTranslator.py
CODONS.py
FastaParser.py
sequence.fasta
README.md

To test the code, run the BioTools file, which has test code at the bottom. The Fastaparser is simple and designed only for testing purposes; it will be refined at a later time.
