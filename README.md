# Biotools

BioTools takes an input DNA, RNA, or amino acid sequence and performs the following: Sequence manipulation, FASTA parsing, DNA homology, and determining possible coding sequences and their likelihood by examining consensus nucleotides.

There are eight files:

biotools.py - main

bioanalyzer.py - Finds potential coding sequences in segment of DNA.

biosequence.py - DNA/RNA manipulation

biotranslator.py - DNA to amino acid manipulations.

fastaparser.py - parse FASTA files

CODONS.py - dictionary of amino acid code to codon.

sequence.fasta - test sequences

README.md

To test the code, run the BioTools file, which has test code at the bottom.
