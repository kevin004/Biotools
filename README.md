# Biotools
Sequence manipulation, FASTA parsing, and DNA homology.

There are four files:
Biotools.py
Fastaparser.py
sequence.fasta
README.md

To test the code, I run the biotools file, which has test code at the bottom. The Fastaparser is simple and designed only for testing purposes; it will be refined at a later time.
